This project combines **YOLOv9** for object detection and **DeepSORT** for object tracking, creating a powerful tool for real-time video analytics and multi-object tracking. The integrated system can detect and track multiple objects across video frames, supporting various applications such as surveillance, traffic monitoring, and automated inspection.

## Project Overview

### What is This Project?

This project brings together two advanced algorithms:
- **YOLOv9** (You Only Look Once): A state-of-the-art, real-time object detection algorithm that provides high accuracy and speed, capable of detecting multiple object classes in a single forward pass.
- **DeepSORT** (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking with a Deep Association Metric): A multi-object tracking algorithm that associates detected objects across frames using motion and appearance cues, making it robust for real-world applications.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Detection and Tracking**: Capable of handling high FPS video streams.
- **Multi-Object Tracking**: Tracks multiple object instances, assigning unique IDs for each instance.
- **Flexibility**: Supports various configurations for single, dual, and triple tracking setups, adaptable to different use cases.
- **Benchmarking and Performance Evaluation**: Includes scripts to benchmark the model and assess accuracy and runtime performance.

## How It Works

1. **Detection with YOLOv9**:
   YOLOv9 detects objects in each frame of a video, classifying them into predefined classes. This model outputs bounding boxes and class scores for each detected object.

2. **Tracking with DeepSORT**:
   After detection, DeepSORT assigns each detected object a unique ID, allowing consistent tracking across frames. DeepSORT uses a combination of motion information (via Kalman filtering) and appearance features (via a deep learning-based association metric) to maintain accurate tracking.

3. **Data Flow**:
   - Each frame is processed by YOLOv9 to detect objects.
   - The detections are passed to DeepSORT, which associates them with previously tracked objects based on similarity metrics.
   - The final output is a video or sequence with each object consistently labeled across frames.

## Problem It Solves

This integrated system addresses several real-world challenges:
- **Real-Time Multi-Object Tracking**: Ideal for applications that require instant feedback, such as live surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and event monitoring.
- **Reduced Complexity in Data Analysis**: Provides structured data on object trajectories, which can be used for further analysis, like calculating movement patterns, density, and duration.
- **Scalability**: Supports multiple objects and can adapt to various scenarios by simply adjusting detection classes or model configurations.
